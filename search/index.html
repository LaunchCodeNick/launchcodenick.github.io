							"content": "Webpage\nA webpage is a document that is commonly written using HTML (hypertext markup language) that is viewed using a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer.\n\n\n\nMarkup Language\nA markup language uses tags that annotate text to change behavior or describe content .  Two markup languages you’ll encounter frequently are HTML, which is used to write web pages, and XML, which is often used to store program data or configuration settings.\n\n\n\nTags\nHTML tags usually follow a standard sequence of opening tag, followed by the text to be tagged, followed by a closing tag.\n\n    &lt;tag&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag&gt;\n\n\n\nUse any text editor to complete the following tasks.  We recommend Notepad++ which you can download from the tools page:\n\n1. Create a new text file and write the following text inside the document\n\n    Hello World!\n\n\n\n2. Save the file as “helloworld.html”\n3. Open the file using a web browser to view it\n\nYou should see a very simple webpage with the Hello World! text in it.\n\n4. Add a bold tag to the text in your file with the following code:\n\n    &lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;\n\n\n\n5.  Refresh your web browser to see the changes in your helloworld.html webpage.\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in a bold font.\n\n\n\nAttributes\nMany tags can have one or more optional attributes that go inside the opening tag.\n\n    &lt;tag attribute=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\"&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag&gt;\n\n\n\n6. Let’s change the font face and size of your text with the following code:\n\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger!\n\nNotice how your web browser did not write any of the new words (font, face, size) to the screen.  The browser is built to process HTML tags and render webpages accordingly.\n\n\n\nNested Tags\nMarkup languages are also capable of nesting tags to apply multiple behaviors to content.\n\n    &lt;tag1&gt;&lt;tag2 attribute=\"value\"&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag2&gt;&lt;/tag1&gt;\n\n\n\n7.  Let’s nest our two examples with the following code:\n\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger, and just the word Hello should be in bold!\n\n8.  Finally, let’s try one extra special tag:\n\n    &lt;sparkle&gt;Make this text shine!&lt;/sparkle&gt;\n\n\n\nDoes your text sparkle?  Probably not :(\n\n9.  Hmmm, let’s try this variation that uses an attribute instead:\n\n    &lt;font sparkle=\"on\"&gt;Make this text shine!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nHow about now, does your text sparkle? No, it doesn’t?\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nHow does your web browser know which keywords are legitimate tags and attributes?  \nWhy did &lt;b&gt; and &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt; work, but &lt;sparkle&gt; and &lt;font sparkle=\"on\"&gt; did not?\n\n\n\nFounded in 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the Web.  It was created to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web.\n\nProgrammers that develop web browsers (for example, Google developers make Chrome and Apple developers make Safari) do their best to follow standards set by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.  This means recognizing a standard list of tags and attributes and rendering them in an expected fashion.  &lt;b&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, and font attributes of \"face\" and \"size\" are all recognized standards.  However, &lt;sparkle&gt; and a font attribute of \"sparkle\" are not!\n\nIt's import to know that not every browser follows these standards perfectly.  Some browsers have been programmed to recognize extra tags or attributes, or they can interpret and render tags differently.  \n\nHave you ever encountered a webpage that wasn't working, and someone recommended that you try using a different browser?\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Structure\n\nOne standard set forth by W3C is that HTML pages should be structured with 4 main parts:\n\n\n  a line containing HTML version information\n  a &lt;html&gt; tag\n  a header section\n  a body, which contains the document’s actual content\n\n\nLet’s see how that looks in HTML:\n\n10. Create a new text file called pagestructure.html, type this code, and view it:\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should see a familiar Hello World! on the screen, but look at the title bar of your web browser or browser tab.  It should say “Look at the browser bar!” now.\n\n11.  Change your code to match what’s below.  What do you expect to be different?\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nWhat, if anything, was different between the code examples in the two previous examples?\n\n\n\nThe answer is that nothing should be different between the two examples!\n\nWith HTML, extra spacing, indentation tabs, and new lines do not change how a web page is rendered.\n\nHowever, these formatting items are used by programmers to make code more readable.  As your web pages grow in size and complexity, it will be easier to maintain them if you use some level of formatting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting\n\nYou can also include comments for yourself or other programmers who may work on your code in the future.  These comments will not be displayed by the web browser, but are visible in the source code file only.\n\nDifferent programming languages have various ways of allowing you to write comments, the following is how it’s done in HTML:\n\n    &lt;!-- this is text that is only seen when looking at the code --&gt;\n\n\n\n12.  Try writing your own comments for your file, something similar to:\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;        \n            &lt;!-- this is what will display in my browser's title bar --&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;!-- I wanted to make Hello World! look a lot bigger --&gt;\n            &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

							"content": "Your First Web Lab\n\nCongratulations, you’ve been commissioned by Banksy, a street artist, to create a small portfolio webpage that showcases 6 of his art works.\n\nBanksy would like the webpage to look like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe Life of a Programmer\n\nYou may be thinking to yourself, “Hmmm, I haven’t learned how to put images on a webpage, I haven’t learned how to center text on a webpage, and I haven’t learned how to put a link on a webpage.”\n\nYou’re right!  It’s important to know that this is typical and normal in the life of a programmer.  We are often asked to do things that we haven’t learned just yet.\n\nWhat’s important in this lab is that you begin to learn how to look up programming resources, adapting their information to the problem at hand!\n\n\n\nStart with what you know\n\nOf all the things we’re being asked to do, we do know how to structure a basic webpage with text, so let’s start there to get some momentum started.\n\n1.  Create a new text file called banksy.html\n\n2.  Give this file the basic page structure elements of a webpage.\n\n3.  Add text to the webpage that says “Banksy, a street artist” and “Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.”  Do your best to format the text with the right size and font.\n\n\n\nIs all your text on the same line?\n\nYou haven’t learned how to put text on different lines yet, so there’s a good chance it’s all running together on one line right now.  Is this happening on your webpage?\n\n4.  Head to Google.com and try searching for an answer to your problem.  In programming, putting text on a new line is often referred to as a “line break” or “carriage return.”  But you wouldn’t know these terms yet!  So let’s search using terms you might guess at:\n\n    How do I put text on a new line in html?\n    I need my html text on different lines\n    Basic HTML text formatting\n\n\n\nChoose a search or two that seems good to you.  Then, take a few minutes to read through the top 3 or 4 results returned.\n\n5.  Experiment with some of the potential solutions you’re finding.  Try them in your webpage and see if you can get the two texts on different lines.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 1\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but these are probably the most commonly expected!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this solution uses paragraph tags of &lt;p&gt; to create line breaks --&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this solution uses a line break tag of &lt;br&gt; to create a line break --&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you didn’t find one of these answers, that’s okay!  What’s important is that you start cultivating a mindset that is comfortable not knowing all of the answers upfront.  As you search for more answers over time, you’ll develop a strength and confidence in the ability to find answers to the new problems that you’ll face on a daily basis.\n\nLet’s proceed using the code from Answer 1a.\n\n\n\nIs your text centered?\n\nBanksy’s request seems to have the text centered in the page.  If you’re working with the code from Answer 1a above, then our text is not centered.\n\n6.  Use Google to search for “how do I center my html paragraph text?”\n\n7.  Find and use an attribute for the paragraph tag that we can use to center the text.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 2\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is probably the most commonly expected!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- this uses a paragraph attribute of &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt; to center text --&gt;\n    &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nVisual checkpoint:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding images\n\nOkay, our text looks great, it’s time to add some images!  To add images, you’ll need to save them locally to your computer or have the web address link to them if they are hosted on the internet.\n\nDownload each of these images into the same directory as your banksy.html file.\n\nbanksy_1.gif\nbanksy_2.jpg\nbanksy_3.jpg\nbanksy_4.jpg\nbanksy_5.jpg\nbanksy_6.jpg\nbanksy_logo.gif\n\n8.  Use Google to search for how you can add images to an html webpage.\n\n9.  Try adding the banksy_1.gif to your webpage.\n\nIf you’re successful in getting the image to appear on the screen, you should notice that it’s gigantic compared to its size in the Banksy request.\n\n10.  Use Google to search for an image attribute you can use to resize the image.  Try different sizes and see if you can find one that will get you close to the relative size in the Banksy request.\n\n11.

							"content": "Searching for Answers\n\nWhat was your experience like trying to find answers on your own?\n\n\n\nCommon Questions\n\nWhy are the images offset?  They don’t appear to be perfectly aligned.\n\nThey appear offset for two reasons:\n\n1. The images themselves contain whitespace around the edges.  You can edit your image tags with the following attribute to see:\n\n    &lt;img src=\"banksy_4.jpg\" border=\"3\"&gt;\n\n\n\n2. Not all the images are exactly the same size unless you specified both the height and width of them all.  When images of different sizes are put next to one another, the images will end up aligning to an edge, such as the bottom, or the top.  In this case, some of the images align on the bottom.\n\nVisual proof (with border=”3” on all the image tags):\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\n\nWhat other questions or insights do you have?\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nUse Google to search for basic html tags.  Find a guide for beginners and scan some of the tags listed to see what HTML can do.\n\nYou’ll find a wide variety of resources out there.  Some are far too simple and will only have 5 tags for you.  Others are too exhaustive and will try to list every tag that exists.  What tends to be the most helpful at this stage, is something in the middle.\n\nGood examples:\nhttp://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf"

Explain what is wrong with the following code.  How would you fix it?\n\nClick on the Answer tab to see the answer!\n\n\n\nThere are 3 issues with this code.\n1.  &lt;font&gt; needs an ending tag of &lt;/font&gt; to come after Hello World!\n2.  The font attribute of size should be inside of double quotation marks like so size=\"20\".  This is not a hard error, but is a good practice.\n3.  The closing &lt;p&gt; tag should be &lt;/p&gt; instead.\n\nSolution:\n&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n3.  Imagine there is an HTML tag called Faketag.

What is different about these two blocks of code?\n\nClick on the Answer tab to see the answer!\n\n\n\nAs far as HTML is rendered, nothing is different about these code examples.  The second one, however, is more readable to a human programmer because the indentation makes it easier to follow the sequence and nesting of tags.\n\n\n\n5. In Examples 1 and 2 above, if you had to give someone instructions on how to indent their code to change it from Example 1 to Example 2, how would you explain it?\n\nClick on the Answer tab to see the answer!\n\n\n\nThe essence of this answer should say something close to \"Use a new indent or tab each time you nest another tag.  When you close a tag, align it under its opening tag.\""

							"content": "User input\n\nSo far, you’ve learned how to display text, images, and links on a webpage.  Many of these elements are referred to as output, which are things that our code will display to a user.\n\nBut what if you want to collect information from a user?  For example, Google.com has a text box to ask what a user wants to search.  Elements that a user can type or change the state of are often referred to as input.\n\n\n\nTextbox\n\nThe textbox might be the most common input element across all of programming.  Here in HTML, we’re going to use the following code to put one on our page.\n\n&lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"a name for your textbox\" /&gt;\n\n\n\nNotice that there is no separate closing tag!  But the opening tag closes itself with a /&gt;\n\n1.  Create a new html file called textbox.html and write the basic page structure elements and place a textbox named “search” in the body.\n\n    After you've tried, if you need a hint, you can click on the example tab.\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search\" /&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n2.  View your page in a web browser.  Try typing the word “iPhone” into the textbox and try pressing enter.\n\nYou should be able to type text in the box, but the enter key should not do anything.\n\n\n\nForms\n\nIn order to bring your HTML input elements to life, you’ll need to put them inside a form.  Once a form wraps the input elements on a page, the enter key will submit the webpage which either triggers a page refresh or takes us to a completely new webpage.\n\nWe’re going to use the following code to put one on our page:\n\n&lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go!\" /&gt;  &lt;!-- good practice to put a \"submit\" button in each form --&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n\n3.  Update your code, type the word “iPhone” into the textbox and press enter again.\n\n4.  Look at the address of your webpage in the web browser.  What do you notice is different?\n\nWhen a form’s action is set to “get”, the values of all input elements in a form get placed on the web address.  We call these querystring parameters.\n\n5.  Place a second textbox on your form named “search2”.\n\n6.  Type the word “iPhone” in the first textbox, and type the word “radio” in the second textbox.  Press the enter key and look at your browser’s address bar.\n\nWhen a form’s method is set to “get”, a “?” is added to the end of the original web address to signal the beginning of querystring parameters.  Then each input element gets added with a name=value convention, and multiple input elements are separated with a “&amp;”.\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://samplewebsite.com/searchpage.html?search1=iPhone&amp;search2=radio\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal Websites\n\nDid you know that many Internet websites use “get” forms?\n\n7.  Head to http://www.amazon.com and enter iPhone as a search term.  Press enter and look at the address bar.  Can you find the name of the input element and see your search term in the address bar?\n\nAt the time of writing this lesson, the website url looks like this:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=iphone\n\n\n\nYou can see very easily that the name of the textbox was “field-keywords” and that my search term is attached to it.  There are also several other querystring parameters that Amazon is using, but if you try searching a few different things, you will see these values aren’t changing, meaning they aren’t affected by a user’s input.\n\n\n\nSubmitting a Form to External Websites\n\nDid you know that we can make our textbox.html page interact with Amazon.com?\n\n8.  Update your form tag with an action attribute with the enter Amazon address before the “?”, and change the name of the first textbox to “field-keywords”:\n\n&lt;form method=\"get\" action=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"field-keywords\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search2\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go!\" /&gt; \n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n\n9.  Type “iPhone” in the first textbox and “radio” in the second textbox.  Press enter or click the form button and see what happens.\n\nYour search page should work with Amazon! The second textbox has a name that Amazon doesn’t recognize, so its value is ignored by their program.  However, the first search box should control the search results from Amazon.\n\nChallenge Question\n\nIn your own words, what is happening and how did we make this happen?\n\n\n\nWe visited Amazon.com and tried using their search engine.  We noticed they use querystring parameters, because we could see the search terms go up into the address bar.  We created our own web form and gave a textbox the exact same name that we saw in the Amazon address bar (\"field-keywords\").  Then we told our form, when submitted, to pass all of its infomation via querystring to an Amazon web address."
