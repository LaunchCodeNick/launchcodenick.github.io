							"content": "Webpage\nA webpage is a document that is commonly written using HTML (hypertext markup language) that is viewed using a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer.\n\n\n\nMarkup Language\nA markup language uses tags that annotate text to change behavior or describe content .  Two markup languages you’ll encounter frequently are HTML, which is used to write web pages, and XML, which is often used to store program data or configuration settings.\n\n\n\nTags\nHTML tags usually follow a standard sequence of opening tag, followed by the text to be tagged, followed by a closing tag.\n\n    &lt;tag&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag&gt;\n\n\n\nUse any text editor to complete the following tasks.  We recommend Notepad++ which you can download from the tools page:\n\n1. Create a new text file and write the following text inside the document\n\n    Hello World!\n\n\n\n2. Save the file as “helloworld.html”\n3. Open the file using a web browser to view it\n\nYou should see a very simple webpage with the Hello World! text in it.\n\n4. Add a bold tag to the text in your file with the following code:\n\n    &lt;b&gt;Hello World!&lt;/b&gt;\n\n\n\n5.  Refresh your web browser to see the changes in your helloworld.html webpage.\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in a bold font.\n\n\n\nAttributes\nMany tags can have one or more optional attributes that go inside the opening tag.\n\n    &lt;tag attribute=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\"&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag&gt;\n\n\n\n6. Let’s change the font face and size of your text with the following code:\n\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger!\n\nNotice how your web browser did not write any of the new words (font, face, size) to the screen.  The browser is built to process HTML tags and render webpages accordingly.\n\n\n\nNested Tags\nMarkup languages are also capable of nesting tags to apply multiple behaviors to content.\n\n    &lt;tag1&gt;&lt;tag2 attribute=\"value\"&gt;text to be tagged&lt;/tag2&gt;&lt;/tag1&gt;\n\n\n\n7.  Let’s nest our two examples with the following code:\n\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nYour Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger, and just the word Hello should be in bold!\n\n8.  Finally, let’s try one extra special tag:\n\n    &lt;sparkle&gt;Make this text shine!&lt;/sparkle&gt;\n\n\n\nDoes your text sparkle?  Probably not :(\n\n9.  Hmmm, let’s try this variation that uses an attribute instead:\n\n    &lt;font sparkle=\"on\"&gt;Make this text shine!&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\n\nHow about now, does your text sparkle? No, it doesn’t?\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nHow does your web browser know which keywords are legitimate tags and attributes?  \nWhy did &lt;b&gt; and &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt; work, but &lt;sparkle&gt; and &lt;font sparkle=\"on\"&gt; did not?\n\n\n\nFounded in 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the Web.  It was created to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web.\n\nProgrammers that develop web browsers (for example, Google developers make Chrome and Apple developers make Safari) do their best to follow standards set by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.  This means recognizing a standard list of tags and attributes and rendering them in an expected fashion.  &lt;b&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, and font attributes of \"face\" and \"size\" are all recognized standards.  However, &lt;sparkle&gt; and a font attribute of \"sparkle\" are not!\n\nIt's import to know that not every browser follows these standards perfectly.  Some browsers have been programmed to recognize extra tags or attributes, or they can interpret and render tags differently.  \n\nHave you ever encountered a webpage that wasn't working, and someone recommended that you try using a different browser?\n\n\n\n\n\nPage Structure\n\nOne standard set forth by W3C is that HTML pages should be structured with 4 main parts:\n\n\n  a line containing HTML version information\n  a &lt;html&gt; tag\n  a header section\n  a body, which contains the document’s actual content\n\n\nLet’s see how that looks in HTML:\n\n10. Create a new text file called pagestructure.html, type this code, and view it:\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should see a familiar Hello World! on the screen, but look at the title bar of your web browser or browser tab.  It should say “Look at the browser bar!” now.\n\n11.  Change your code to match what’s below.  What do you expect to be different?\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nWhat, if anything, was different between the code examples in the two previous examples?\n\n\n\nThe answer is that nothing should be different between the two examples!\n\nWith HTML, extra spacing, indentation tabs, and new lines do not change how a web page is rendered.\n\nHowever, these formatting items are used by programmers to make code more readable.  As your web pages grow in size and complexity, it will be easier to maintain them if you use some level of formatting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting\n\nYou can also include comments for yourself or other programmers who may work on your code in the future.  These comments will not be displayed by the web browser, but are visible in the source code file only.\n\nDifferent programming languages have various ways of allowing you to write comments, the following is how it’s done in HTML:\n\n    &lt;!-- this is text that is only seen when looking at the code --&gt;\n\n\n\n12.  Try writing your own comments for your file, something similar to:\n\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;head&gt;        \n            &lt;!-- this is what will display in my browser's title bar --&gt;\n            &lt;title&gt;Look at the browser bar!&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;/head&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;!-- I wanted to make Hello World! look a lot bigger --&gt;\n            &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

							"content": "Your First Web Lab\n\nCongratulations, you’ve been commissioned by Banksy, a street artist, to create a small portfolio webpage that showcases 6 of his art works.\n\nBanksy would like the webpage to look like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe Life of a Programmer\n\nYou may be thinking to yourself, “Hmmm, I haven’t learned how to put images on a webpage, I haven’t learned how to center text on a webpage, and I haven’t learned how to put a link on a webpage.”\n\nYou’re right!  It’s important to know that this is typical and normal in the life of a programmer.  We are often asked to do things that we haven’t learned just yet.\n\nWhat’s important in this lab is that you begin to learn how to look up programming resources, adapting their information to the problem at hand!\n\n\n\nStart with what you know\n\nOf all the things we’re being asked to do, we do know how to structure a basic webpage with text, so let’s start there to get some momentum started.\n\n1.  Create a new text file called banksy.html\n\n2.  Give this file the basic page structure elements of a webpage.\n\n3.  Add text to the webpage that says “Banksy, a street artist” and “Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.”  Do your best to format the text with the right size and font.\n\n\n\nIs all your text on the same line?\n\nYou haven’t learned how to put text on different lines yet, so there’s a good chance it’s all running together on one line right now.  Is this happening on your webpage?\n\n4.  Head to Google.com and try searching for an answer to your problem.  In programming, putting text on a new line is often referred to as a “line break” or “carriage return.”  But you wouldn’t know these terms yet!  So let’s search using terms you might guess at:\n\n    How do I put text on a new line in html?\n    I need my html text on different lines\n    Basic HTML text formatting\n\n\n\nChoose a search or two that seems good to you.  Then, take a few minutes to read through the top 3 or 4 results returned.\n\n5.  Experiment with some of the potential solutions you’re finding.  Try them in your webpage and see if you can get the two texts on different lines.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 1\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but these are probably the most commonly expected!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this solution uses paragraph tags of &lt;p&gt; to create line breaks --&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;!-- this solution uses a line break tag of &lt;br&gt; to create a line break --&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you didn’t find one of these answers, that’s okay!  What’s important is that you start cultivating a mindset that is comfortable not knowing all of the answers upfront.  As you search for more answers over time, you’ll develop a strength and confidence in the ability to find answers to the new problems that you’ll face on a daily basis.\n\nLet’s proceed using the code from Answer 1a.\n\n\n\nIs your text centered?\n\nBanksy’s request seems to have the text centered in the page.  If you’re working with the code from Answer 1a above, then our text is not centered.\n\n6.  Use Google to search for “how do I center my html paragraph text?”\n\n7.  Find and use an attribute for the paragraph tag that we can use to center the text.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 2\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is probably the most commonly expected!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- this uses a paragraph attribute of &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt; to center text --&gt;\n    &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nVisual checkpoint:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding images\n\nOkay, our text looks great, it’s time to add some images!  To add images, you’ll need to save them locally to your computer or have the web address link to them if they are hosted on the internet.\n\nDownload each of these images into the same directory as your banksy.html file.\n\nbanksy_1.gif\nbanksy_2.jpg\nbanksy_3.jpg\nbanksy_4.jpg\nbanksy_5.jpg\nbanksy_6.jpg\nbanksy_logo.gif\n\n8.  Use Google to search for how you can add images to an html webpage.\n\n9.  Try adding the banksy_1.gif to your webpage.\n\nIf you’re successful in getting the image to appear on the screen, you should notice that it’s gigantic compared to its size in the Banksy request.\n\n10.  Use Google to search for an image attribute you can use to resize the image.  Try different sizes and see if you can find one that will get you close to the relative size in the Banksy request.\n\n11.  Add the other images to your webpage, resize them, and do your best to put them on the same lines as the Banksy request.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 3\n\nClick the answer tab to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is ours!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;A Bit of Banksy&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;    \n        &lt;img src=\"banksy_logo.gif\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Banksy, a street artist&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;Born in Bristol, England circa 1974.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;  \n        &lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"banksy_1.gif\" width=\"200\" /&gt; &lt;img src=\"banksy_2.jpg\" width=\"200\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"banksy_3.jpg\" width=\"200\" /&gt; &lt;img src=\"banksy_4.jpg\" width=\"200\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"banksy_5.jpg\" width=\"200\" /&gt; &lt;img src=\"banksy_6.jpg\" width=\"200\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nTake a few minutes to compare your code to this answer’s code.

							"content": "Searching for Answers\n\nWhat was your experience like trying to find answers on your own?\n\n\n\nCommon Questions\n\nWhy are the images offset?  They don’t appear to be perfectly aligned.\n\nThey appear offset for two reasons:\n\n1. The images themselves contain whitespace around the edges.  You can edit your image tags with the following attribute to see:\n\n    &lt;img src=\"banksy_4.jpg\" border=\"3\"&gt;\n\n\n\n2. Not all the images are exactly the same size unless you specified both the height and width of them all.  When images of different sizes are put next to one another, the images will end up aligning to an edge, such as the bottom, or the top.  In this case, some of the images align on the bottom.\n\nVisual proof (with border=”3” on all the image tags):\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\n\nWhat other questions or insights do you have?\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nUse Google to search for basic html tags.  Find a guide for beginners and scan some of the tags listed to see what HTML can do.\n\nYou’ll find a wide variety of resources out there.  Some are far too simple and will only have 5 tags for you.  Others are too exhaustive and will try to list every tag that exists.  What tends to be the most helpful at this stage, is something in the middle.\n\nGood examples:\nhttp://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf"

The font attribute of size should be inside of double quotation marks like so size=\"20\".  This is not a hard error, but is a good practice.\n3.  The closing &lt;p&gt; tag should be &lt;/p&gt; instead.\n\nSolution:\n&lt;p&gt;\n    &lt;font face=\"Arial\" size=\"20\"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n3.

What is different about these two blocks of code?\n\nClick on the Answer tab to see the answer!\n\n\n\nAs far as HTML is rendered, nothing is different about these code examples.  The second one, however, is more readable to a human programmer because the indentation makes it easier to follow the sequence and nesting of tags.\n\n\n\n5. In Examples 1 and 2 above, if you had to give someone instructions on how to indent their code to change it from Example 1 to Example 2, how would you explain it?\n\nClick on the Answer tab to see the answer!\n\n\n\nThe essence of this answer should say something close to \"Use a new indent or tab each time you nest another tag.  When you close a tag, align it under its opening tag.\""

							"content": "User Input\n\nSo far, you’ve learned how to display text, images, and links on a webpage.  Many of these elements are referred to as output, which are things that our code will display to a user.\n\nBut what if you want to collect information from a user?  For example, Google.com has a text box to ask what a user wants to search.  Elements that a user can type or change the state of are often referred to as input.\n\n\n\nTextbox\n\nThe textbox might be the most common input element across all of programming.  Here in HTML, we’re going to use the following code to put one on our page.\n\n&lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"a name for your textbox\" /&gt;\n\n\n\nNotice that there is no separate closing tag!  But the opening tag closes itself with a /&gt;\n\n1.  Create a new html file called textbox.html and write the basic page structure elements and place a textbox named “search” in the body.\n\n    After you've tried, if you need a hint, you can click on the example tab.\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search\" /&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n2.  View your page in a web browser.  Try typing the word “iPhone” into the textbox and try pressing enter.\n\nYou should be able to type text in the box, but the enter key should not do anything.\n\n\n\nForms\n\nIn order to bring your HTML input elements to life, you’ll need to put them inside a form.  Once a form wraps the input elements on a page, the enter key will submit the webpage which either triggers a page refresh or takes us to a completely new webpage.\n\nWe’re going to use the following code to put one on our page:\n\n&lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go!\" /&gt;  &lt;!-- good practice to put a \"submit\" button in each form --&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n\n3.  Update your code, type the word “iPhone” into the textbox and press enter again.\n\n4.  Look at the address of your webpage in the web browser.  What do you notice is different?\n\nWhen a form’s action is set to “get”, the values of all input elements in a form get placed on the web address.  We call these querystring parameters.\n\n5.  Place a second textbox on your form named “search2”.\n\n6.  Type the word “iPhone” in the first textbox, and type the word “radio” in the second textbox.  Press the enter key and look at your browser’s address bar.\n\nWhen a form’s method is set to “get”, a “?” is added to the end of the original web address to signal the beginning of querystring parameters.  Then each input element gets added with a name=value convention, and multiple input elements are separated with a “&amp;”.\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://samplewebsite.com/searchpage.html?search1=iPhone&amp;search2=radio\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Characters\n\nThere are some text characters that don’t work as part of a web address.  This is often because they are characters used in internet addresses.  So, if your querystring parameter value contains one of these special characters, they will get translated to a special code, a process we call url encoding.\n\nTo see an example, try the following search terms and review your web browser bar to see how the querystring parameter looks.\n\n7.  Type “test space” into the first textbox and “test:colon” into the second textbox\n\nYou should see the space character encoded as a + sign and the : character encoded as %3A\n\n8.  Type “test&amp;ampersand” into the first textbox and “test@at” into the second textbox\n\nYou should see the &amp; character encoded as %26 and the @ character encoded as %40\n\n9.  Type “test/slash” into the first textbox and “test\\backslash” into the second textbox\n\nYou should see the / character encoded as %2F and the \\ character encoded as %5C\n\n10.  Type “test+plus” into the first textbox and “test%percentage” into the second textbox\n\nYou should see the + character encoded as %2B and the % character encoded as %25\n\nThe presence of a % in an address bar usually signals that a parameter has been url encoded.\n\n\n\nExternal Websites\n\nDid you know that many Internet websites use “get” forms and querystring parameters?\n\n11.  Head to http://www.amazon.com and enter iPhone as a search term.  Press enter and look at the address bar.  Can you find the name of the input element and see your search term in the address bar?\n\nAt the time of writing this lesson, the website url looks like this:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=iphone\n\n\n\nYou can see very easily that the name of the textbox was “field-keywords” and that my search term is attached to it.  There are also several other querystring parameters that Amazon is using, but if you try searching a few different things, you will see these values aren’t changing, meaning they aren’t affected by a user’s input.\n\n\n\nSubmitting a Form to External Websites\n\nDid you know that we can make our textbox.html page interact with Amazon.com?\n\n12.  Update your form tag with an action attribute with the enter Amazon address before the “?”, and change the name of the first textbox to “field-keywords”:\n\n&lt;form method=\"get\" action=\"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"field-keywords\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"search2\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Go!\" /&gt; \n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n\n\n13.  Type “iPhone” in the first textbox and “radio” in the second textbox.  Press enter or click the form button and see what happens.\n\nYour search page should work with Amazon! The second textbox has a name that Amazon doesn’t recognize, so its value is ignored by their program.  However, the first search box should control the search results from Amazon.\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nIn your own words, what is happening and how did we make this happen?\n\n\n\nWe visited Amazon.com and tried using their search engine.  We noticed they use querystring parameters, because we could see the search terms go up into the address bar.  We created our own web form and gave a textbox the exact same name that we saw in the Amazon address bar (\"field-keywords\").  Then we told our form, when submitted, to pass all of its infomation via querystring to an Amazon web address."

							"content": "Web Forms\n\nSo far, you’ve learned two types of input controls, a textbox and a submit button.  In HTML, there are a few more types of input controls that you can use.  Let’s try using some of them to see how they work!\n\n1.  Take a few minutes to use google.com to look for a list of HTML input controls.\n\nYou should find a few different types of controls that include textboxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, and regular buttons.\n\n\n\nSamburgers needs your help!\n\nCongratulations, a local business called Samburgers has asked you to help them implement a small online ordering form.  Here’s what they would like their website to look like:\n\n\n\n2.  Start with what you know to build some momentum.  Create a file called cart.html . You should be able to create the “Shopping Cart”, “Price, Quantity, Item”, and “Calculate Your Order” lines.  Pay attention to font size and face.\n\n3.  Add the divider lines you see on the page.  These are called “horizontal rules” and you might not have stumbled upon the tag for it yet.  If not, use Google to find the correct HTML tag to draw the line.\n\n4.  Add a submit button to the page.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 1\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is one way to complete the steps so far.\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Samburgers Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;    \n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;\n            &lt;font size=\"20\"&gt;Shopping Cart&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;br&gt;\n            Price, Quantity, Item&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;hr&gt;            \n            &lt;br&gt;            \n            Calculate Your Order\n            &lt;hr&gt;                    \n            &lt;input type=\"submit\" /&gt;  \n        &lt;/font&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nVisual checkpoint:\n\n\n\n\nHamburger Line Item\n\nLet’s work on adding the hamburger line.\n\n5.  You should be able to create the price and quantity textboxes and the word “Hamburger” for the line.\n\nA good solution should have textboxes that aren’t too big or too small!\n\n6.  Make the first textbox readonly since it contains the price per hamburger.  This isn’t something we want the customer to edit.\n\n7.  Add the checkboxes and text for Cheese and Special Sauce.\n\n8.  Make sure each input control has a name.\n\nWithout a name, the values of input controls won’t be passed to the querystring when the form is submitted.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 2\n\nClick the answer tabs to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is one way to complete the steps so far.\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Samburgers Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;    \n        &lt;font face=\"Arial\"&gt;\n            &lt;font size=\"20\"&gt;Shopping Cart&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;br&gt;\n            Price, Quantity, Item&lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;hr&gt;\n            &lt;!-- Hamburger line item --&gt;\n            &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"hamburger_price\" value=\"$4.95\" size=\"3\" readonly /&gt; \n            &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"hamburger_quantity\" size=\"3\" value=\"0\" /&gt; \n            Hamburger\n            &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"hamburger_cheese\"&gt;Cheese (+$0.30)\n            &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"hamburger_sauce\"&gt;Special Sauce (+$0.30)\n            &lt;br&gt;\n            &lt;!-- End of the Hamburger line item --&gt;\n            &lt;br&gt;\n            Calculate Your Order\n            &lt;hr&gt;                    \n            &lt;input type=\"submit\" /&gt;  &lt;input type=\"reset\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/font&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nVisual checkpoint:\n\n\n\n\nFries Line Item\n\nLet’s work on the fries line item!\n\n9.

							"content": "Static vs. Dynamic Web Pages\n\nSo far, you’ve built “static” web pages by writing HTML to files.  Assuming you are finished with these files, you will always see the same thing when you open them - this is the definition of “static.”\n\nBut the most interesting pages on the Internet are not static, they are “dynamic.”  Take an Amazon search results page, for example.  If you search for iPhone cases, you will see a web page with iPhone case information.  If you search for radios, you will see a web page with radio information.  Although the web page itself is the same file, it will display differently depending on certain factors, such as user input.  We call this a dynamic web page.\n\n\n\nThe Architecture of Static and Dynamic Web Pages\n\nStatic web pages can be very easy to build.  In fact, you’ve been building them with a text editor and then opening them directly with a web browser!  Static web pages are built directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (you have not learned the last two!)\n\nA dynamic web page, however, often requires something called a back-end programming language.  This back-end language can create, edit, manipulate, or remove HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to change what a web page displays, as the page is actually being requested!\n\nThe following can be used as back-end programming languages:\n\n\n  C#.NET\n  Java\n  Node.JS\n  Perl\n  PHP\n  Python\n  Ruby\n\n\nObviously, we will use Java for this course!\n\n\n\nA High-Level Example\n\nA dynamic web page might include HTML and a bit of back-end Java together in the same file.  Notice that the Java code is written between &lt;% and %&gt;.\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;% // this is a made up Java function, but go with it!\n       makeTenTextboxes();  %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\nWhen this page is called by a user, an application called a “web server” will execute the code on this page and return a final HTML file to the user:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox1\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox2\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox3\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox4\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox5\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox6\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox7\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox9\" /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"textbox10\" /&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nIt’s this type of technology that lets the Amazon search results page display iPhone items if you searched for iPhones, or radio items if you searched for radios.  You can use Java code to dynamically write HTML code when the page is requested!\n\n\n\nWeb Servers\n\nGoing forward, we will need a web server to make dynamic web applications.  The web server is going to change how we open/locate our web pages.  We won’t write a simple text file any longer and then open it directly in a web browser.\n\nInstead, we will put our files inside the directory of a web server.  And we will view them by making a request through the web server’s address.\n\nWhen we set up a web server on your computer, we call that a local installation.  The name of your web server will almost certainly be “localhost” and you will view pages on it by visiting “http://localhost:8080/examplepagename.html”\n\nYou will install a web server in your next lab and start to understand how this is all set up!\n\n\n\nApache Tomcat\n\nYou may be wondering: what’s a good web server to use for Java web applications?  How would I know this?  What if I choose to make applications in another language someday, what server would be good then?\n\nTypically, you’ll want to stick with the crowd on this sort of thing.\n\n1. Use Google to search for the the most common web servers for Java applications.\n\nYou should find that Apache Tomcat is the most common web server for Java applications, so that is what we will use in this course.\n\n\n\nJava\n\nIn order for Apache to work with Java, we also need to install Java!\n\nThere are two types of Java installations you will find: the Java Run-time Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK).\n\nComputers that only need to run Java applications can install the JRE.  But computers that need the ability to run and develop Java applications should install the JDK (which includes the JRE).  So we will install the Java JDK in this course.\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

The first is to run programs with their full name and location like this:\n\n\n\nThe second solution is to add C:\\FOLDER to the Windows PATH variable.  If we do this, we can run test.exe from just about any location.  The computer will know to check every directory that is included in the PATH variable.\n\nWe need to do this for key Java and Apache Tomcat directories.\n\n5.  Create a Java environment variable.\n\nRight-click on Computer and go to Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Environment Variables\n\nMake a ‘New’ User Variable.  Enter JAVA_HOME as the variable name, and the location of your Java directory as the variable value.  On my computer this is C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_101\n\n\n\n6.  Create an Apache Tomcat variable.\n\nMake a ‘New’ User Variable.  Enter CATALINA_HOME as the variable name, and the location of your Apache directory as the variable value.  On my computer this is C:\\apache\\apache-tomcat-8.5.6\n\n\n\n7.  Add your JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME variables to the PATH variable.\n\nFind the PATH variable, and click ‘Edit’.  On the very end of the variable value, at the far right, add the following (there are semicolons in front of the % signs):\n\n;%JAVA_HOME%\\bin ;%CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\n\n8.

Try visiting both to see they are the same.\n\n\n\nHello World JSP File\n\n14.  Create a new file called index.jsp and place it in the ROOT/test folder.\n\n15.  Edit the file so the text contains the following:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    This text is written in HTML.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;% out.println(\"This text is written in &lt;b&gt;Java!&lt;/b&gt;\"); %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n16. Visit http://localhost:8080/test to see your file.  Oops!  You are probably seeing something that says, “This is the default file…”  What do you need to do so that your index.jsp file is the default file for the test folder?\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lab, see you in the next unit!"

							"content": "Java Servlet Page (JSP)\nA JSP is a HTML file that contains blocks of Java code within it.  The Java code is executed when the page is requested and can change the final HTML output that is delivered to a web browser.  This is what makes JSP a dynamic web page.\n\n\n\nHello World!\nIn the lab to test your Apache Tomcat installation, you learned that the Apache ROOT folder is where your web files will need to go.\n\nYou also created your first Hello World JSP file and named it index.jsp and placed it a ROOT\\test folder.  Let’s make one more!\n\n1.  Start up Apache Tomcat.\n\nOpen a command line or terminal window and start your Apache Tomcat server.\n\nOn Windows, you should be able to do this by typing ‘startup.bat’\n\nOn Mac, you should be able to do this by typing ‘sh startup.sh’\n\n2.  Create a new file in your Apache ROOT\\test folder named ‘hello_world.jsp’.\n\n3.  Use the following code for your hello_world.jsp file.\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%= \"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World!\" %&gt;\n    &lt;% out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World 2!\"); %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n4.  Remember that your Apache is hosting web files at http://localhost:8080 .  What should the web address of this Hello World file be?\n\nClick the 'Answer' tab to see the correct web address.\n\n\n\nIt should be http://localhost:8080/test/hello_world.jsp\n\n\n\n5.  Visit your Hello World page and examine the output.\n\nNotice that the webpage was able to process the HTML  tag with no trouble.\n\n6.  Right click on the web page and choose ‘View Page Source’.  You can use this feature to look at the final HTML that was delivered to the web browser.\n\nBoth lines of Java code printed similar Hello World text.  The first line used a &lt;%= opening tag. Notice the equal sign!  When you use an equal sign, you are saying that you want some text inserted into the HTML page.\n\nWhen you use the &lt;% without the equal sign, you can use multiple lines of Java to do something, which will eventually allow you to write much more complex code.\n\n7.  Let’s quickly change your code to the following:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%= \"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World!\" %&gt;\n    &lt;% \n        out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World 2!\"); \n        out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World 3!\"); \n        out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World 4!\"); \n        out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World 5!\"); \n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nNotice that we could put multiple lines of Java inside one group of &lt;% %&gt; tags.\n\n\n\nStrings\n\nIn the world of programming, any kind of text value is generally referred to as a string.  You can think of this as a string of individual text characters.\n\nWhenever we use string text in Java, it needs to be wrapped in double quotation marks (this one: “).\n\n8.  Remove the quotations from the following line in your JSP page and see what happens when you refresh the page.\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%= &lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; World! %&gt; &lt;!-- no more double quotations here! --&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should get a compile error.  The web server is unable to process the Java in this web page.\n\n9.  Multiple individual strings can be added together by using a + operator.  Try the following code:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%= \"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt;\" + \" \" + \"World!\" %&gt; &lt;!-- add strings together with a + operator --&gt;\n    &lt;% out.println(\"&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt;\" + \" \" + \"World 2!\"); %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSemicolons\n\nSo what were those semicolons about?\n\nHTML is largely a language that says “this is how a web page should look.”  By contrast, Java is a language we’ll use to run multiple steps in a particular sequence.\n\nIf you like analogies, we can think of baking a cake.  HTML is sort of like the beautiful picture of the finished cake.  Java is like the individual steps required to make the cake.\n\nWhen you see a recipe, it usually comes in specific steps.\n\n1.  Preheat the oven\n2.  Grab a bowl\n3.  Crack some eggs into the bowl.\n\nIn Java, each step that needs to run is separated by a semicolon:\n\nPreheat the oven;\nGrab a bowl;\nCrack some eggs into the bowl;\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nRemember Algebra class?  How we would write things like x = 7.  Well in Java (and many other languages), we can do a similar thing.\n\n10. Let’s make a String variable called myfirstvariable and set it equal to “Hello World!”.\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n        String myfirstvariable = \"Hello World!\";\n        out.println(myfirstvariable); // don't use double quotes around a variable name!\n        out.println(\"myfirstvariable\"); // see what happens if we do...\n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n11.  Let’s make two String variables and add them together:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n        String variable1 = \"Hello\";\n        String variable2 = \"World!\";\n        out.println(variable1 + \" \" + variable2);\n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers\n\nIn this lecture, we’ve talked about text called Strings.  But that is just one “data type” in Java.  We’ll often want to work with numbers too.\n\nThere are a few different kinds of numeric data types.  These types often have nuanced characteristics.  Some can’t hold decimals well (1.78 for example), some can’t hold gigantic numbers (100,000,000,000,000 for example).\n\nWhy are there different kinds at all?  These flavors of numeric data types often exist to manage how much computer memory a program will consume.  It takes more computer memory to store gigantic numbers than small ones, and more memory to store numbers with decimals than non-decimal numbers.  We won’t run into memory problems in this course, but this is a good thing to know!\n\n12.  Use Google.com to search for Java numeric data types.  See if you can identify a few of them.\n\nClick the 'Answer' tab to see Java's numeric data types.\n\n\n\nbyte 1 byte -128 to -127.\nshort 2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767.\nint 4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.\nlong 8 bytes -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,80.\nfloat 4 bytes 7 decimal digits.\ndouble 8 bytes 16 decimal digits.\n\n\n\n13.  Let’s write some code that uses numeric variables:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World JSP!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n        int number1 = 10; // no quote marks on numeric values!\n        int number2 = 1;\n        int total = number1 + number2;\n        \n        out.println(number1 + number2);\n        out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n        out.println(\"the total is: \" + number1 + number2);\n        out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n        out.println(\"the total is: \" + (number1 + number2));\n        out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n        out.println(\"the total is: \" + total);\n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nOf the four methods that the previous code example used, the second one did not work.\n\nWhy do you think that is?\n\nClick the 'Answer' tab to discover the issue.\n\n\n\nWhen adding different data types together, in this case a String of \"the total is: \", and numeric values of 10 and 1, Java wants to convert each variable that follows to a String.\n\nJava turned the 2nd example into \"the total is: \" + \"10\" + \"1\"\n\nThe reason the 3rd example works is because Java processes (number1 + number2) first, and then it converts it to a String.  The parentheses helped Java to understand what to do first.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

							"content": "Working with Java Variables\n\nIn this lab, we’re going to do some exercises to get comfortable working with numbers, Strings, and another data type called a boolean.\n\n\n\nFile Setup\n\n1. Inside your Apache ROOT folder, create a folder named test.\n\n2. Create a file in this test folder named data_types.jsp\n\n3. Use the following starter code:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data Type Lab&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n        out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");\n        out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");        \n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n4.  Visit your web page to make sure it works!\n\nYou may need to start Apache Tomcat first.  The page url should be http://localhost:8080/test/data_types.jsp\n\n\n\nNumeric Data: Integers\n\nLet’s start with one of Java’s most common numeric data types: the integer.\n\nIntegers are whole numbers (no decimals) that can be positive or negative.\n\nFor example, -1000,-475, 0, 1, 2, 200, 2000.\n\nWe can declare an integer using the keyword ‘int’ and assign a value to it using one equal sign.\n\nEdit the Java portion of your web page to the following:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    int myvariablename = 0;\n    out.println (myvariablename);\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n5.  Refresh your page to see the output.\n\nYou should see a zero appear on your screen!\n\n6.  You can use many of the math operators you’d expect to work, and you can also use parenthesis to structure an order of operation.\n\nTry the following code:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    int myvariablename1 = 0 + 1 + 2;\n    int myvariablename2 = 1 + 2 * 3;\n    int myvariablename3 = (1 + 2) * 3;\n    int myvariablename4 = 4 / 2;\n    out.println (myvariablename1); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename2); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename3); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename4); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n7.  Remember that an integers do not have decimals.  What do you think will happen when we try something like 5 / 2?\n\nTry the following code:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    int myvariablename1 = 5 / 2;\n    out.println (myvariablename1); \n%&gt;\n\n\n\nBe careful when dividing integers if the exact value matters to you.  If you do need the decimals, it may be wise to leverage another numeric data type such as a ‘double’.\n\n\n\nNumeric Data Types: Doubles\n\nA double is a data type that can hold a much larger number and ones with decimals.\n\n8.  Let’s use the following code and see some doubles in action:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    double myvariablename1 = 5 / 2; // this line will not yield 2.5\n    double myvariablename2 = 5.0 / 2.0;\n    double myvariablename3 = 3.0 * 3.0;\n    out.println (myvariablename1); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename2); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename3); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nNotice that even though we are using doubles, the numbers themselves must be written with a decimal to get operators such as division correct!\n\n\n\nMixing Doubles and Integers\n\n9.  Let’s test what will happen if you mix doubles and integers in the same calculation:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    double myvariablename1 = 5.0 / 2;\n    double myvariablename2 = 5 / 2.0;\n    double myvariablename3 = 3.0 * 3;\n    out.println (myvariablename1); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename2); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (myvariablename3); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nWhen mixing numeric data types, the code will generally use and resolve to the type that can include the other.  For example, an integer can’t represent a double of 0.5, but a double can represent any integer.  So when mixing the two, a double will be the outcome.\n\n\n\nBoolean Data Type\n\nSometimes, all we need to store in a variable is whether something is true or false.  We call this a boolean.\n\n10.  Let’s see some booleans in action with the following code:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    boolean isSmart = true;\n    boolean isRichLikeBillGates = false;    \n    out.println (isSmart); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (isRichLikeBillGates); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings\n\nYou’ve already been exposed to Strings in some of your Hello World examples.  A String is some amount of text we need to store, such as “Hello World!”  Strings are wrapped in double quotation marks.\n\n11.  Let’s see some strings in action with the + operator.  When we add strings together, we call that concatenation.\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n    \n    String firstWord = \"hello\";\n    String secondWord = \"world\";\n    String allWords = firstWord + secondWord;\n    out.println (firstWord); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (secondWord); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (firstWord + secondWord); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println (allWords); out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nDon’t expect that Java will put a space between Strings that you add together!\n\n\n\nConverting Numbers to Strings\n\n12.  It’s not often that you’ll want to convert a number into a String.  Usually, this occurs when you want to print a number to the screen.\n\nIf we try something like out.println(“this is a zero: “ + 0), it will work but what Java is really doing is converting the 0 to a String of “0” and adding them together.\n\nUse the following code to see an example:\n~~~ html\n&lt;%\n    out.println(“&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;”);\n\nout.println (\"this is a zero: \" + 0); \nout.println (\"this is a zero: \" + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0);  %&gt; ~~~\n\n\n\n13.  You can force Java to do any sort of numeric calcuations before Java converts numbers into a string by using parentheses.\n\nTry this:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n        \n    out.println (\"this is a zero: \" + 0); \n    out.println (\"this is a zero: \" + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0)); \n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting Strings to Numbers\n\nWhat if you have to go the other way and convert a String to a number?  You may have to do that because user input might be captured as a String, but actually contains a number.\n\n14.  Try this code:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n\n    String hamburgerQuantityText = \"4\";\n    int hamburgerQuantity = hamburgerQuantityText;\n    hamburgerQuantity = hamburgerQuantity * 2; // double my order!\n    \n    out.println (\"I have this many hamburgers: \" + hamburgerQuantity);     \n%&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should get an error that says, “cannot convert from String to int.”\n\nWe will need to use special commands in Java to convert numbers into Strings.\n\n15.  Try this code instead:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(\"&lt;p&gt;This is our Data Type Lab!&lt;/p&gt;\");            \n\n    String hamburgerQuantityText = \"4\";\n    int hamburgerQuantity = Integer.parseInt(hamburgerQuantityText);\n    hamburgerQuantity = hamburgerQuantity * 2; // double my order!    \n    out.println (\"I have this many hamburgers: \" + hamburgerQuantity);    \n\n    String hamburgerPriceText = \"4.95\";\n    double hamburgerPrice = Double.parseDouble(hamburgerPriceText);\n    out.println (\", each one costs me: \" + hamburgerPrice + \n                 \", unless I have a 10% coupon which would make them: \" + \n                 (0.90 * hamburgerPrice));    \n%&gt;\n\n\n\nInteger.parseInt() and Double.parseDouble() are commands you may need in a later lab!\n\n\n\nCongratulations, we’re finished with this lab.  See you in the debrief!"

							"content": "Evaluating Numeric Expressions in Java\n\nIn order for us to use Java code that will run in just some cases, we will need to learn a combination of If statements and evaluating expressions.\n\nFor example, if the temperature is less than 60 degrees, I’ll wear a sweater.  If the temperature is more than 80 degrees, I’ll wear shorts.\n\n1.  Lets create a file in our ROOT\\test folder called if.jsp\n\n2.  Create the barebones HTML code for it, and then view the webpage in your browser.\n\n3.  Use the following code in your page and see what prints out:\n\n&lt;%\n    out.println(80 &gt; 60);    \n    out.println(80 &lt;= 60);\n        \n    // in Java, we test for numerical equality using two equal signs\n    out.println(80 == 60); \n%&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should see the results of our three expressions: true, false, and false.  Yes, 80 is greater than 60, it’s not less than or equal to 60, and it’s not equal to 60.\n\n\n\n4.  This also works with variables.  Let’s try the following code:\n\n&lt;%\n    int x = 80;\n    double y = 60.0;\n    \n    out.println(x &gt; y);    \n    out.println(x &lt;= 10);\n        \n    // in Java, we test for numerical equality using two equal signs\n    out.println(x == y); \n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Strings in Java\n\nWhen we want to evaluate whether two Strings are equal, however, we need to use slightly different code.  The underlying reason is because numeric data types are primitive data types in Java, and Strings are not.  Strings are actually a form of something called an Object, which is a very important concept you will learn later in this course.\n\nFor now, you just need to know that you can evaluate Strings using the method below:\n\n&lt;%\n    String animal = \"lion\";\n    String kingOfTheJungle = \"lion\";    \n     \n    out.println(animal.equals(kingOfTheJungle));        \n    out.println(kingOfTheJungle.equals(animal));        \n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Statements in Java\n\nIn programming, we often need to execute code in a certain condition.\n\nWe use an ‘if’ statement and then a set of curly braces { }.  Any statements inside the { and }, immediately after an If statement will execute if the statement evaluates as true.\n\n5.  Try the following code:\n\n&lt;%\nString animal = \"lion\";\n\nif (animal.equals(\"lion\") == true) {\n    out.println(\"ROAR!\");\n}\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should see a mighty roar!\n\n6.  What if the animal isn’t a lion?  Try the following code:\n\n&lt;%\nString animal = \"mouse\";\n\nif (animal.equals(\"lion\") == true) {\n    out.println(\"ROAR!\");\n} else if (animal.equals(\"mouse\") == true) {\n    out.println(\"eek!\");\n}\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nWe can test for more conditions by using an ‘else if’ statement.\n\n7.  What if the animal is something we probably couldn’t predict?  Try this:\n\n&lt;%\nString animal = \"a ridiculously tall Giraffe named Sam\";\n\nif (animal.equals(\"lion\") == true) {\n    out.println(\"ROAR!\");\n} else if (animal.equals(\"mouse\") == true) {\n    out.println(\"eek!\");\n} else {\n    out.println(\"whoa!\");\n}\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you need a catch-all clause in case you have no idea what else might come, or it really is a situation of lion or anything else at all, you can use an ‘else’ statement at the end of your if-block.\n\n8.  If statements can also test for multiple conditions using AND or OR type operators.  In Java, we use &amp;&amp; to signal an AND operator, and we use || to signal an OR operator.\n\n&lt;%\nboolean isBig = true;\nboolean isScary = true;\nString animal = \"\";\n\nif (isBig &amp;&amp; isScary) {\n    animal = \"lion\";\n} else if (isBig == true &amp;&amp; isScary == false) {\n    animal = \"panda bear\";\n} else if (isScary == true) {\n    animal = \"snake\";\n} else {\n    animal = \"butterfly\";\n}\n\nif (animal.equals(\"lion\") || animal.equals(\"snake\")) {\n    out.println(\"Run away from a \" + animal + \"!\");\n} else {\n    out.println(\"I love this \" + animal + \"!\");\n}\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nTry writing a series of if, else if, and else statements that will print the letter grade associated with a test score.\n\nAnything greater than or equal to a 90 should be an A.\nAnything greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90 should be a B.\nAnything greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80 should be a C.\nAnything greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70 should be a D.\nAnything less than 60 should be a F.\n\nClick the 'Answer' tab after you've tried to complete this challenge!\n\nThere are many possible variations, but this is just one solution.\n\n\n\n&lt;%\nint testScore = 82;\nString letterGrade = \"\";\n\nif (testScore &gt;= 90) { \n    letterGrade = \"A\";\n} else if (testScore &gt;=80) {\n    letterGrade = \"B\";\n} else if (testScore &gt;=70) {\n    letterGrade = \"C\";\n} else if (testScore &gt;=60) {\n    letterGrade = \"D\";\n} else {\n    letterGrade = \"F\";\n}\n\nout.println(\"A test score of \" + testScore + \" translates to a letter grade of \" + letterGrade + \".\");\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Scope\n\nThe last concept in this lecture is on a topic called Scope.  Scope is used to define the concept that variables don’t exist everywhere all the time.  They only exist within a certain scope of code.\n\n9.  Try this example to see what happens:\n\n&lt;%\nboolean isTrue = true;\n\nif (isTrue) {\n    String scopeExample = \"watch this\";\n}\n\nout.println(scopeExample);\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should get an error that says “scopeExample cannot be resolved to a variable.”  Since scopeExample was declared inside a set of { } braces, and so it isn’t accessible outside of them.\n\n\n\n10.  Now, try this example to see what happens:\n\n&lt;%\nboolean isTrue = true;\n\nif (isTrue) {\n    String scopeExample = \"watch this\";\n    if (isTrue) {\n        out.println(scopeExample);\n    }\n}\n%&gt;\n\n\n\nThis example works because scopeExample was declared at a higher level than it’s being used.  It was already declared before a statement inside of a nested { } referenced it.\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nWhich of the following variables are being referenced out of scope?\n\n&lt;%\nboolean isTrue = true;\nString apple = \"apple\";\n\nif (isTrue) {\n    String cherry = \"cherry\";\n    if (isTrue) {\n        String grape = \"grape\";\n        out.println(cherry);\n    }\n    out.println(grape);\n}\n\nout.println(apple);\n%&gt;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\nClick the 'Answer' tab after you've tried to complete this challenge!\n\n\n\nGrape is the only variable that is referenced out of scope.  It was declared inside the most nested set of { }, and then referenced outside of them. \n\nBoth apple and cherry variables are declared outside of { } tags that they were referenced inside of - which is totally fine!\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

							"content": "Working with Java Variables and If statements\n\nIn this lab, we’re going to do some work with variables and if statements to solve a numerical challenge.\n\nYour program needs to declare an integer variable called ‘pennies’ and set it equal to 798.\n\nThen, your program needs to calculate how to convert those pennies to a more efficient form of change in dollars and coins.  For example, 798 pennies should receive 7 dollars, 3 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickles, and 3 pennies of change.\n\nAlthough you should know this, here’s a reference table just in case:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Money\n      Equals this number of pennies\n    \n    \n      Dollars\n      100\n    \n    \n      Quarters\n      25\n    \n    \n      Dimes\n      10\n    \n    \n      Nickles\n      5\n    \n    \n      Pennies\n      1\n    \n  \n\n\nThe final output of your program should not print a type of coin if the value is zero.  For example:\n\n798 pennies should be converted to the following change:\n\n7 dollars\n3 quarters\n2 dimes\n3 pennies\n\n\n\n798 pennies should be converted to the following change:\n\n7 dollars\n3 quarters\n2 dimes\n0 nickles\n3 pennies\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Setup\n\nThis lab will not contain multiple steps and checkpoints for you.  Instead, please work with a partner to think through this problem!\n\nYou have learned all of the programming concepts necessary to complete this challenge.  It may be a good strategy to solve this on paper before you write any code.  How would you do this in real life without a computer?\n\n\n\nOne Hint\n\nIn case you are really struggling with this lab, at the 15-minute mark, you may take a look at this hint to see how to start your lab!\n\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data Type Lab&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n        int pennies = 798;  // the initial count of pennies              \n        int penniesRemaining = pennies; // how many pennies still need to be accounted for \n        \n        int dollars = penniesRemaining / 100;\n        int penniesRemaining = penniesRemaining - (dollars * 100);        \n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Completion\n\nIf you believe your lab is finished and correct, please try changing the penny count to the following numbers and see how your program works:\n\n512 pennies\n100 pennies\n27 pennies\n1 penny\n0 pennies\n-45 pennies\n\n\n\nCongratulations, we’re finished with this lab.

Anticipating errors and handling them is referred to as error handling (obviously!)."

So if you divided 10 by 3, the remainder would be 1.  10 % 3 will yield 1 in Java.\n\nTo solve the even or odd problem, even numbers will have 0 remainder when divided by 2.  Odd numbers will have a remainder of 1.\n\nint age = 41;\n\nif ((age % 2) == 0) {\n    out.println(\"even\");\n} else {\n    out.println(\"odd\"); \n}"

Create a file in your ROOT/test folder called request.jsp and use the following starter code:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Requesting Parameters&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"color\" /&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /&gt;\n        &lt;%\n            String color = request.getParameter(\"color\");\n            out.println(\"the color is: \" + color);\n        %&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n2.

Not the word ‘null’, but an actual value of null.\n\n3.  Try typing different names of colors into the textbox and see what prints out.\n\nYou should see your values in both the querystring and printed out on the page.\n\n4.  Try changing the value in your browser bar to see if it will work that way too.  Visit: http://localhost:8080/test/request.jsp?color=robinseggblue\n\n5.  Try this version that might work a little easier on the eyes: http://localhost:8080/test/request.jsp?color=robins+egg+blue\n\n\n\nStrings, Strings, Strings\n\nIt’s important to know that everything on the querystring is going to be retrieved as a String, even numbers!\n\n6. Change your code to the following:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Requesting Parameters&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"number\" /&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /&gt;\n        &lt;%\n            int myNumber = request.getParameter(\"number\");            \n        %&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nYou should get a variable type mismatch error! request.getParameter only returns Strings!  Strings for everything!\n\n7.  Let’s capture a number as a String then convert it to an integer using Integer.parseInt();\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Requesting Parameters&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"textbox\" name=\"number\" /&gt;\n        &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" /&gt;\n        &lt;%\n            String myNumberAsString = request.getParameter(\"number\");            \n            \n            if (myNumberAsString != null) { \n                int myNumber = Integer.parseInt(myNumberAsString);\n                out.println(\"the number is: \" + myNumber);\n            }\n        %&gt;\n    &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n8.  Try entering 2 into the textbox and submitting the form.\n\n9.  Try entering X into the textbox and submitting the form.\n\nWe need to be careful when processing a String that we expect will contain a number.  If bad data slips into the String, it could cause a major error.  We will learn how to handle this in a future lab.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, we’re finished with this lecture.  See you in the lab!"

							"content": "Back to the Shopping Cart!\n\nFor this lab, we’re going to keep working with our Shopping Cart page and add an order total to the bottom.\n\n\n\nFile Setup\n\n1. Inside your Apache ROOT folder, create a folder called Cart (no spaces).\n\n2. Copy your cart.html page into your Cart folder.\n\n3. Rename cart.html to cart.jsp\n\n\n\nCapture Querystring Parameters\n\nIn JSP, we can use the following convention to retrieve querystring parameters:\n\n&lt;% String x = request.getParameter(\"parameter_name\"); %&gt;\n\n\n\nIt’s important to know that in Java, these commands are case-sensitive!  Upper and lowercase letters matter!\n\nThis will NOT work:\n\n&lt;% string x = REQUEST.GETParameter(\"parameter_name\"); %&gt;\n\n\n\n4. Add some code at the bottom of your page to get values of some querystring parameters:\n\nCalculate Your Order\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;%\n    String hamburgerPrice = request.getParameter(\"hamburger_price\");\n    String hamburgerQuantity = request.getParameter(\"hamburger_quantity\");\n%&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"submit\" /&gt;  \n&lt;input type=\"reset\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n5.  Now, add some text to display the values of your variables:\n\nCalculate Your Order\n&lt;hr&gt;        \n&lt;%\n    String hamburgerPrice = request.getParameter(\"hamburger_price\");\n    String hamburgerQuantity = request.getParameter(\"hamburger_quantity\");\n    \n    out.println(\"Hamburger Price: \" + hamburgerPrice);\n    out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println(\"Hamburger Quantity: \" + hamburgerQuantity);\n    out.println(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\");\n%&gt;            \n&lt;input type=\"submit\" /&gt;  \n&lt;input type=\"reset\" /&gt;\n\n\n\n6.  Visit your page.  It should be at http://localhost:8080/cart/cart.jsp . What does your page say is the current hamburger price and quantity?\n\nYour page says they are both ‘null’ (which means empty) if there are no values in the querystring!\n\n7.  Enter a value of 1 for the Hamburger quantity and then click the ‘Submit’ button.  What does your page say now?\n\nYour page should say that the price is $4.95 and the quantity is 1.\n\n8.  Create variables for every input element on your form.  Display them at the bottom.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 1\n\nClick the answer tab to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is ours!\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Samburgers Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;

The first problem is that to add up $ amounts, we’d love to have our variables stored as numeric data types.  Unfortunately, our variables are currently stored as Strings because that’s what querystring values are.\n\n9.  Try changing one of your request.getParameter lines to the following, and then refresh your page:\n\nint hamburgerQuantity = request.getParameter(\"hamburger_quantity\");\n\n\n\nYou should get a compile error because Java won’t let you casually place a String text value into a numeric variable.\n\n10. You can ask Java to convert a String to a numeric type with special commands.  For a String to int conversion, use this:\n\nint hamburgerQuantity = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"hamburger_quantity\"));\n\n\n\n11. Change all of your Quantity variables to int data types using Integer.parseInt.\n\n12. Try changing your hamburger price variable to the double data type (because it can handle decimals) using Double.parseDouble();\n\ndouble hamburgerPrice = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter(\"hamburger_price\"));\n\n\n\nYou should receive an error.  Look at the error page and see if you can identify the “root cause”.  Java is saying it found an error, or exception, because of an input string “$4.95”.  As it turns out, we can’t convert “$4.95” to a numeric data type because it contains a dollar sign character!  However, we can convert “4.95” to a numeric data type.\n\n13.  Remove all of the dollar signs from your HTML input controls.  Try the code from line 11 again.\n\nYikes, you might get another error!  Look at the error page again and see if you can identify the “root cause”.  This time the error is different, and you should see a NullPointerException.  Java can’t convert a null String into a numeric data type.  When we first visit the web page, there are no querystring parameters because we haven’t submitted the form yet.  We will need to add a little code to solve the problem.\n\n14.  We’re going to change our page so that we only try to store and calculate variables when the form has been submitted.\n\nThe question now is: how can we figure out when the form has been submitted?  We’re going to add a name to our submit button and then check for it first with our Java code.\n\nChange your submit button code to the following:\n\n&lt;input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" /&gt;\n\n\n\nNow add an “if” statement that looks like the code below.  An “if” statement will only run the code inside the { } braces if the statement is true.  The != operator means “not equals.”  So the statement below is saying only run our code if the querystring parameter for “submit” is not null (meaning not empty or missing).\n\nif (request.getParameter(\"submit\") != null) {\n    double hamburgerPrice = Double.parseDouble(request.getParameter(\"hamburger_price\"));\n    int hamburgerQuantity = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(\"hamburger_quantity\"));\n    // put all the rest of your existing code here too, this is just a short code example!\n}\n\n\n\n15.  Convert all of your price variables to double data types, and convert all of your quantity variables to int data types.  Make sure to add null value checks!\n\n16.  Test your page.  Try changing some of the values and submitting the form a few times.\n\n\n\nCheckpoint 2\n\nClick the answer tab to see how your code stacks up.  \n\nThere are many potential solutions, but this is ours!\n\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Samburgers Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;form method=\"get\"&gt;

							"content": "All Programmers Make Errors\n\nEven the very best programmers write programs with errors.  Part of what makes a programmer great is the ability to quickly find, fix, prevent, and gracefully handle errors.\n\nSome interesting facts about programming errors from the Internet:\n\n\n  Estimated that 50-90% of programmers’ time is spent debugging code\n  A typical programmer write 70 bugs per 1,000 lines of code\n  Fixing a bug takes 30 times longer than writing a line of code\n\n\nSo if you have already encountered some level of frustration with errors, you’re not alone!\n\nIf we can get better at dealing with them, we can spend more of our time dreaming up new ideas and writing the code to bring them into life.\n\n\n\nMajor Error Classes: Syntax Error\n\nThe easiest type of error to describe is a syntax error.  This is usually the result of a typo, incorrect capitalization, or missing semicolon.\n\nFor example, take a look at this code:\n\n// this line is fine\nString x = \"test\";\n\n// this line is not okay, string should be String\nstring x = \"test\";\n\n// these lines are not okay, missing ;\nout.println(\"test\")\nout.println(\"test2\")\n\n\n\nIf you’re fortunate, you’ll have an error display that will give you the error and a line number to track the exact origin of the error.\n\n\n\nEach of these syntax errors will stop Java during any compilation of the code.  Compilation means that Java is trying to turn your code into a working executable file.  There can’t be a single syntax error for successful compilation.\n\nAs we progress in this course, we will eventually stop using a simple text editor and move-into a development environment that can assist with highlighting syntax errors.\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nWhy doesn’t a HTML error cause a page crash, but a Java error will?\n\nFor example, why doesn’t this code crash a page?\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;I have no closing tag\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\nThe answer is that HTML is not a compiled language, in fact, it’s not even a programming language.  HTML is a protocol: a standard language to transfer information over the Internet.  But, HTML is not compiled into an executable “program” to run on your computer.  It is processed by a web browser for display.\n\nJava, on the other hand, is a compiled language.  Java programs are compiled into byte-code, which is a platform independent version of machine code.  The target machine is the Java Virtual Machine, and not the underlying architecture.\n\n\n\nMajor Error Classes: Logical or Semantic Errors\n\nA logical error can take on many forms, but basically your code may run without a compile error, yet still fail to produce the intended result.\n\nFor example,\n\n\nif (weather==\"dry\") {boolean putOnRaincoat = true;} // should be false;\n\n\n\nor\n\n// calculating 3 pieces of pizza for 10 people plus 5 backup slices\nint totalPizzaSlices = 30 * 10 + 5; //should be 3 * 10 + 5, or even better (3*10)+5\n\n\n\nThese errors can be extremely difficult to find because nothing breaks!  Your program will just quietly produce incorrect results.\n\nThe best ways to manage these errors:\n* Review your code thoroughly\n* Test your code with many ‘cases!’  When we did the money change lab, we tried several different cases at the end to see how our code would run.\n\n\n\nMajor Error Classes: Run-time Errors\n\nRun-time errors, by definition, occur while the program is being used (execution), and not when the program is built (compilation).\n\nOften times, run-time errors occur because of the unexpected.  Bad user data and suddenly missing or corrupt file are examples of potential causes.\n\n\nString x = \"14\";\nint i = Integer.parseInt(x); // should be fine\n\n//what if x somehow became set to something non-numeric?\nString x =\"14x\";\nint i = Integer.parseInt(x); // run-time error\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can locate and gracefully handle run-time errors using error-catching syntax called try-catch blocks.\n\n\n\nTry-Catch Blocks\n\nIn many programming languages, we can use the concept of a try-catch block to attempt some lines of code.  If the code does create an error, we will have the program jump down to a new section of code, the catch block, to identify the error and figure out what to do next.\n\ntry {\n    String x = \"14x\";\n    int i = Integer.parseInt(x); // run-time error\n    out.println(\"this won't print, the program will jump down to the catch block\");\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    out.println(\"ERROR!!!!\" + \"&lt;br&gt;\");\n    out.println(e.getMessage());        \n}\n\n\n\nYou may also use a try-catch-finally block if you need to ensure some code runs at the end of your block, whether an error occurs or not.  Opening a file, and then making sure that you close it, is a good example.\n\n1.  Use the code below, play with the variable x.  Set it to “14” and then back to “14x”.  See how the page runs.\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Errors&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;%\n    try {\n        String x = \"14x\";\n        int i = Integer.parseInt(x); // run-time error\n        out.println(\"this won't print, the program will jump down to the catch block\");\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        out.println(\"ERROR!!!!\" + \"&lt;br&gt;\");\n        out.println(e.getMessage());        \n    } finally {\n        out.println(\"this prints whether there is an error or not\");\n    }\n    %&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"

							"content": "Error Lab\n\nTo start this lab, find a partner.  You will complete this first half of this lab separately, and then the lab will provide directions on how to work with your partner!\n\n1.  Create a new file in your ROOT\\test folder called errors.jsp\n\n2.  In this file, create a small program with the following instructions:\n\nYour program is going to perform wedding reception calculations.  It should figure out how many tables are needed, and then figure out the total cost of the reception assuming it only includes the cost of tables, food, and decorations.\n\nHere are some exercise guidelines:\n\nYour program should provide variables for the following items:\n* The number of guests wedding partner A invites\n* The number of guests wedding partner B invites\n* Seats per table\n* Cost per table\n* Cost per reception dinner plate\n* Total cost of decorations\n\nYour program should calculate and print the following items:\n* Total number of tables needed\n* Total cost for tables\n* Total cost for food\n* Total cost of decorations\n* Total wedding reception cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Errors\n\nHopefully, you have written a beautifully functional wedding reception calculator.  Now, we’re going to mess it up and hand it over to your partner to fix.\n\n3.  Syntax errors.  Create five syntax errors in your code.  They can be of any flavor you choose, but they must prevent compilation.\n\nSome dastardly ideas for you:\n* Misspelled variables\n* Missing semicolons\n* Incorrect or missing keywords (such as int or double)\n\n4.  Logical errors.  Create three logical errors in your code.  They can be of any flavor you choose, but they shouldn’t prevent compilation.\n\nSome evil genius ideas for you: \n* Incorrect math\n* Using the wrong variables in math formulas\n\n5.  Run-time errors.  Create one run-time error in your code.\n\n\n\nTrade Programs\n\n6.  Exchange programs with your partner!\n\n\n\nFixing Errors\n\n7. Try running the program.  If your partner has completed their task, it should fail.\n\n8. Scan the program and read the code from the first line to the end.  See if you can follow the code, spotting and fixing any syntax errors as you go.  Keep running the program until all compilation errors are fixed.\n\nLook at the type of error the page is reporting.  Is it a compilation error or processing error?  If you find a processing error, that means that compilation has succeeded.  Use try-catch blocks to contain any processing errors.\n\n9. Look at the output of the program and see if you can spot any math that seems off.  How does the program line up with your calculations on paper?\n\n10.  If the program’s output is incorrect, rescan the code and see if you can spot any logical errors.  Try different numbers of guests or seats per table, for example, to help spot more logical errors.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, we’re finished with this lab.  See you in the debrief!"

Later in the course, you’ll also be exposed to anticipating specific kinds of errors.  Right now, we are catching Exception which is the most general catch-all kind of exception in Java, but there are many more specific kinds.\n\n\n\nChallenge Question\n\nIf the first try-catch block errored, do you think it’s wise that the program continues on to calculate costs and display results?  How might you change the solution?\n\nClick the 'Opinion' tab when you're ready to hear one perspective.\n\n\n\nThere's no exactly right answer here, but it doesn't seem to make sense that the rest of the program should continue if a previous block errors.  There are some contrived ways to manage this with if statements and variables, but the cleaner way to approach is this is with multiple 'methods.'

		  				"type": "",							                           
                            "url": "/units/unit3305_methods.html",                            
							"content": "Java Methods\n\nIn programming, a method is a block of code that logically belongs together.  We often use methods because we find ourselves using the same kind of code repeatedly.  Rather than write copies of code all over our program, we can write 1 flexible version of those copies, and then call, or use, that single block of code many times.\n\nMany Java methods perform some steps and then return a value. Look at the following skeleton of a Java method:\n\nreturnType methodName(inputParameter1Type inputParameter1Name, inputParameter2Type inputParameter2Name, ...) {\n    // some lines of code\n    // some more lines of code\n    return returnType;\n}\n\n\n\nLook at this working implementation of this method skeleton:\n\ndouble calculateTotalCost(int numberOfItems, double costPerItem, double salesTaxPercent) {\n    double totalCost = numberOfItems * costPerItem * (1+salesTax);\n    return totalCost;  // the variable being returned must match the returnType of the method\n}\n\n\n\nWe are saying we have a block of code called ‘calculateTotalCost’ that requires 3 input parameters to do its job.  It needs an integer that represents some number of items, a double that represents the cost per item, and a double that represents the sales tax percent.\n\nIf you give this method those 3 items, it will give you something back.  It will give you a double (the first word in the method declaration here) that represents the total cost calculated.\n\n\n\nQuestions?\n\nLet’s intentionally pause here to see if anyone has any questions.\n\n\n\nCalling a Method\n\nAnd here is how we would call, or use, that method in our program:\n\ndouble salesTax = 0.07;\n\nint numberOfTables = 4;\nint costPerTable = 20.00;\n\nint numberOfGuests = 100;\nint costPerDinner = 25.00;\n\n// use the calculateTotalCost method - example #1\ndouble totalTableCost = calculateTotalCost(numberOfTables, costPerTable, salesTax); // use #1\n\n// use the calculateTotalCost method - example #2\n// don't always have to use variables, can pass direct values as well\ndouble totalDinnerCost = calculateTotalCost(numberOfGuests, costPerDinner, 0.07); \n\n// output examples\nout.println(totalTableCost); \nout.println(calculateTotalCost(numberOfTables, costPerTable, salesTax));\n\n\n\nIn this example, we are calling the method twice.  Once to calculate a total cost for tables, and once to calculate the total cost for dinner.  You may be wondering, why are we using a method?  The calculation seems pretty simple.  Eventually, your calculations will become so complex that anything but a method will create extremely long code that is difficult to maintain.\n\nNotice that the names of the variables we pass to the method don’t have to match the names that the method uses (and often will not).  The method has a variable named numberOfItems, and we are giving it numberOfTables there in use #1, and numberOfGuests in use #2.  You can think of this as the code setting numberOfItems = numberOfTables.  It’s not using the variable numberOfTables itself, but rather copying its value into another variable named numberOfItems.\n\nAs a last point with this example, since the value of these parameters are being copied into new variables (something we call passing parameters by value), if we make any changes inside the method to the variable, it will not affect any variable values outside of the method.  See the example below.\n\nint addTen(int x) {\n    x = x + 10; // the x inside the method will be changed\n    return (x);\n}\n\nint y = 96;\nout.println(addTen(y)); // will print 106\nout.println(y); // will print 96, y was never altered\n\nint x = 96; // even if the variable is the same name\nout.println(addTen(x)); // will print 106\nout.println(x); // will print 96, the x outside of the method remains the same\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava Methods Inside of JSP Pages\n\nWe’re going to spend the next few labs creating methods inside of JSP pages.  This is actually not a great practice, so we will move out of doing this shortly.\n\nBut for now, you need to know that using Java methods inside of a JSP requires some specific tags.  Each created method needs to be wrapped inside its own set of &lt;%! %&gt; tags.\n\n\n\n1.  Make a file in ROOT\\test called method.jsp.\n\n2.  Use the following code:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;%!\nint addTen(int x) {\n    x = x + 10;\n    return (x);\n}\n%&gt;\n&lt;%   \nint x = 96; // even if the variable is the same name\nout.println(addTen(x)); // will print 106\nout.println(x); // will print 96, even though a 2nd variable named x becomes 106 inside of addTen\n%&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n3.  Let’s walkthrough what’s happening when we call addTen(), in particular, the exact order of lines being executed by the program.  We’ll use some line numbers below to making referencing easier:\n\n01 int addTen(int x) {\n02    x = x + 10;\n03    return (x);\n04 }\n05\n06 int x = 96; // even if the variable is the same name\n07 out.println(addTen(x)); // will print 106\n08 out.println(x); // will print 96\n\n\n\nThe program will run in this order:\nLine 6\nLine 7 - Starts\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nLine 7 - Ends\nLine 8\n\n4.  Now, let’s change our file to use this code:\n\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;%!\ndouble calculateTotalCost(int numberOfItems, double costPerItem, double salesTaxPercent) {\n    double totalCost = numberOfItems * costPerItem * (1+salesTax);\n    return totalCost;  // the variable being returned must match the returnType of the method\n}\n%&gt;\n&lt;%   \n    double salesTax = 0.07;\n\n    int numberOfTables = 4;\n    int costPerTable = 20.00;\n\n    int numberOfGuests = 100;\n    int costPerDinner = 25.00;\n\n    // use the calculateTotalCost method\n    double totalTableCost = calculateTotalCost(numberOfTables, costPerTable, salesTax);\n    double totalDinnerCost = calculateTotalCost(numberOfGuests, costPerDinner, salesTax);\n\n    // output examples\n    out.println(totalTableCost); \n    out.println(calculateTotalCost(numberOfTables, costPerTable, salesTax));\n%&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Take a few minutes to really look at this code.  Try altering it, or changing the calculation, or return type.  See if you can really follow along with what the code is doing.\n\n\n\nThat’s all for this lecture, see you in the lab!"
